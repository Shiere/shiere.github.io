		&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Atari Shock</B> was a large-scale recession in the video game industry that occurred from 1983 to 1985, primarily in North America, because of market saturation. The crash was a serious event that brought an abrupt end to what is retrospectively considered the second generation of console video gaming in North America.
		&nbsp;&nbsp;The crash shook the then-booming industry, and led to the bankruptcy of several companies producing home computers and video game consoles in the region. It lasted about two years. The Notrh American video game console industry recovered a few years later, mostly due to the widespread success of the <B>Nintendo Entertainment System</B>(NES).
